# Caroline-Aubrey-Architect-Portfolio

This is my second project during my learning path in web development. The webpage is considered a simple and modern portfolio for an architect with a simple layout that shows the architect's work, features, services, and contact using just HTML and CSS. Moreover, The difficult challenge I faced in this project is the media query, which is how to make a webpage responsive to different screens, especially between desktop and mobile screens. Furthermore, there will be more updates on this project whenever I learn something new that may add or change many features in this webpage.
